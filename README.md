# Sparrows Exploration

This repository contains a very early exploratory project using Motus data from southern Ontario to see whether it is possible to identify activity vs rest periods in birds using:

1. signal strength (sig)
2. antenna ports
3. minute-level time series

The work here is only exploratory. The goal is simply to inspect the raw detections, visualise daily patterns, and understand whether changes in signal or antenna switching can indicate movement, rest, or nocturnal behaviour.

Large data files (.rds, .csv) are kept locally and not included in the repository.

More structure will be added later once the exploratory phase is clearer.
